Electric Actuated Ball Valve manufacturer in USA
SVR Global is well known Electric Actuated Ball Valve manufacturer in USA. An electric actuated ball valve is the closed valve. It is used to control the flow of medium or gas through a rotating ball that is connected to the actuator. This valve has a very long lifespan and they provide reliable fixing for the whole life of the valve. An electric actuated ball valve is more dependable and long-lasting than any other valve. They can continue to work admirably even after many years of use and can close securely even after many years of inactivity. These features make them the optimum choice for shutdown and control applications in a variety of sectors. To reduce or increased the pressure and fluid flow in the system, it can also be set to quarter-turn or half-turn settings.
An electric actuated ball valve converts electricity into kinetic energy with the help of an actuator in a rotating motion. Electric actuators are also known as motorized valve actuators. It can control the opening and shut off the electric actuated ball valve. Remote control systems allow responding to commands, making them suitable for controlling systems that are very difficult to access in large regions.

·         Power industry
·         Textile industry
·         Mining industry
·         Chemical industry
·         Pulp and Paper industry
 
Advantages of Electric Actuated Ball Valve:
·        Installation is straight-forward
·        Any medium can handle this type of valve
·        This valve has a very low failure rate
·        This valve provides a leak proofing service
  Electric Actuated Valve Manufacturer in USA
In recent decades, ensuring sustainable production flows has been a top priority for many production or treatment facilities. Companies seek to be efficient while changing to a more CO2-neutral operation. In valve systems, SVR Global, an Electric Actuated Valve Manufacturer in USA,  provides accurate flow control as well as a number of additional benefits. Due to their simple operation style, our electric actuated valves are the safest alternative in isolated and demanding environments.
An electric actuated valve is directly attached to an electric actuator, indicating that the valve is completely automated. 
What is an Electric Actuator?
An electric actuator(sometimes known as motorized or rotary ball valves) is a mechanical device that turns electricity into kinetic energy in a single linear or circular motion. It automatically closes the valve to increase the efficiency and complexity of the process.
